<h2>Voice Commands</h2>
ToonTalk can respond to voice commands while holding widgets or tools.
This is currently enabled only if listen=1 is a URL parameter.
It works in Chrome and some versions of FireFox.
Click to learn if your <a href='http://caniuse.com/#feat=speech-recognition'>browser supports speech recognition</a>.

Note that the first time ToonTalk attemmpts to access the microphone a dialog will appear asking permission.
This will happen repeatedly if you are accessing ToonTalk via HTTP instead of HTTPS.

<h3>The magic wand</h3>
While holding the Magic Wand over a widget you can say <b>"copy"</b> or <b>"abracadabra"</b> and the widget will be copied.
<h3>Dusty the Vacuum</h3>
You can say <b>"suck"</b> or <b>"erase"</b> while the vacuum is over a widget to remove or erase it.
Each time you say <b>"restore"</b> the vacuum will unerase a widget if selected otherwise it will spit out a previously removed item.
If you say <b>"remove all"</b> then everything will be removed (but still can be restored).
<h3>Voice commands that work for all widgets</h3>
You can say <b>"I am ..."</b> or <b>"I'm ..."</b> to provide a description of the widget that is held. 
The description will appear in tool tips and on the back side of the widget.

If the widget has a name (currently robots, birds, and nests) then you can change their name by saying <b>"my name is ..."</b> or <b>"call me ..."</b>.

<b>"times"</b>, <b>"multiply"</b>, <b>"multiplication"</b>, <b>"divide"</b>, <b>"division"</b>, <b>"equal"</b>, or <b>"equals"</b>.
