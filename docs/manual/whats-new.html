<h2>Major changes to ToonTalk</h2>
<p>
<a href='../../index.html' title='Click to go back to ToonTalk.'>ToonTalk</a> is changing all the time.
For the full gory details visit <a href="https://github.com/ToonTalk/ToonTalk/commits/master">the list of changes to the implementation</a>.

<b style="color: brown"><a href='function-birds.html'>Function birds</a> can be given up to three birds for responses</b>.
<p>
Function birds can, instead of having a bird in the first hole of the message box, have a box with one, two, or three holes in the first hole.
The first bird will be given the response, the second one will return the message (so it can be repeatedly re-used), and the third one will receive error messages if there are any.
