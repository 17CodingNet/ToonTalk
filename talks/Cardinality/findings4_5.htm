fractions every one even though there is lots.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;

spend forever counting them but it would be possible.</font></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="6">Susan and Tom said 
that the output of their robots was countable since you can take the first 
fraction off the nest and say “one”, then the next and say “two”, and so on.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt"><font size="6">Ivan had planned 
to modify the robots that generate all the proper fractions to produce the 
rational numbers greater than 1 but then he said:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.5in"><font size="6">So, I'll use the team of robots generating the 
proper fractions to feed my new robot. I will divide 1 by each of the coming 
numbers and give the result to a new bird.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="border: medium none; margin-bottom: 6.0pt; padding: 0in">
  <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="6">“There must be the same number 
  of rational numbers from 0 to 1 as there are from 1 to 2. And from 2 to 3. And 
  3 to 4. So there are an infinite number of intervals of the same size as 0 to 
  1. So there must be an infinite times more rational numbers greater than 1 
  than between 0 and 1.”</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:.5in"><font size="6">Tom says he agrees. [My answer is] Sort of but 
you can’t have &#8734;x&#8734; so what is she [Sally] going on about.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt"><font size="6">Susan then 
suggested starting with the lowest number between 0 and 1 and have it dance with 
the lowest number greater than 1 and so on. Tom asked her how she could get the 
smallest number like that. She saw this was problematic and then she suggested 
they start with those with 1 decimal place, then those with 2 decimal places, 
and so on.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt"><font size="6">The researcher 
said that was a fine way to get the numbers between 0 and 1 dancing with those 
between 1 and 2 but what about all the numbers greater than 1. Susan said you 
could do that too and started a complex explanation until Tom pointed out they 
could use the sequences they just generated.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="6">Sounds reasonable... 
but...</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt">
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><font size="6">So you want me to 
  find a fraction in the interval [0, 1] for each fraction greater than 1 which 
  Sally would choose. In other words, we could combine each number of Sally (&gt;1) 
  with a number &lt;1. That does not seem very difficult, e.g. if she chooses 205/3 
  I'll answer with 3/205, if she chooses 101/11, I'll take 11/101, and so on.</font></span></p>
