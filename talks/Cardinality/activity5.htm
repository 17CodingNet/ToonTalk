<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="6">I brought up Resort Infinity 
and asked whether there was an example of multiplying something by infinity. S 
replied that timesing by infinity was OK there since when 3 infinite groups of 
guests arrived, there were those that hadn’t settled in yet. She said that we 
[S, M and P] were just handling those guests that already arrived. I suggested 
that we set up a process that if it ran forever would accommodate the three 
groups of infinite guests. She nodded.</font></p>
