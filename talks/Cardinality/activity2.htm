<p><font face="Arial" size="6">S said that if the natural numbers paired up with 
the positive integers then all the negative integers would be left over. I 
suggested there were other pairings where they match. I suggested she write down 
the current sequence </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="6">1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3 and under it the natural 
numbers </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="6">1,&nbsp; 2, 3,&nbsp; 4, 5,&nbsp; 6 </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="6">She pointed out that at any point only half as 
many positive (or negative) integers have been done as the natural numbers. I 
suggested she think about it and write down her thoughts. She wrote in response 
to the question of whether she could see a way to get all the natural numbers to 
dance with all the integers: </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="6">The numbers go on forever but for every natural 
  number (1, 2, 3,) there are two integers (1, -1, -2, 2) so although you can 
  write them out and they all pair up, every natural number is also one of the 
  integers but there are twice as many integers. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="6">Later she told me “It doesn’t make sense but it 
must be right” since running forever exhausts both lists.</font></p>
