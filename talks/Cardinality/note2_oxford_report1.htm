<font face="Times New Roman" size="6">We have argued about what a sequence 
actually is and have come to the conclusion that it depends on what you mean by 
sequence. A sequence could be a list of number starting in a certain place, 
changing according to a certain rule each time. Or it could just be the rule, 
e.g. n+1.&nbsp;<br>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="6">Yes, you can't count to the end, we agreed 
that there is no end, we are still not sure if there is a beginning.</font></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial" size="6">S (13-year old girl), T (13-year old boy), and 
A (13-year old boy) quickly decided that sequences without an end couldn’t be 
counted. Though there was some discussion of what countable meant. Then A as the 
scribe wrote sequences without a beginning or end couldn’t be counted. This led 
to a very long discussion of what is a sequence whether it is described as “n+1” 
(and hence could be started anywhere but the “full sequence” could start 
anywhere – A’s position) or as “+1” where you start with some number and 
repeatedly perform actions to obtain the next term. A even claimed that a 
sequence could have no beginning but an end. Everyone thought that was wrong and 
he backed off.</font></i></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial" size="6">A year earlier four children 10 and 11 years 
old discussed this same topic and most thought that there were uncountable 
sequences until one of the boys suggested that there can't be since a robot 
could count the numbers in a sequence.</font></i></p>
