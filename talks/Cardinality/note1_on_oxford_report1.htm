<p class="MsoNormal"><i><font face="Arial" size="6">S (13-year old girl), T 
(13-year old boy), and A (13-year old boy) discussed this
<span lang="EN-GB" style="color:black">before writing their answer. They took 
the “quizmanship” position that the question wouldn’t be asked if there were no 
such sequences. S after a while suggested that maybe there are such sequences 
but they can’t be described. T suggested sequences like “one plus the number in 
my head” but the others rejected that and he agreed. A suggested sequences like 
musical symphonies and the others said it had to be a number sequence. A then 
wondered about the digits of pi and whether that was a sequence and whether it 
can be programmed. T then searched the web for formulas for computing pi. 
Someone suggested a sequence using pi (I think pi, 2pi, 3pi, …) and they 
wondered if computers can deal with irrational numbers. But they thought 
probably not.</span></font></i></p>
