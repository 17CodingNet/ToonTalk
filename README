This is a project to create an improved ToonTalk in JavaScript to run in web browsers.

A paper about ToonTalk Reborn will be presented at Constructionism 2014 in August and can be found here: https://github.com/ToonTalk/ToonTalk/blob/master/docs/TT-Reborn-Constructionism2014_v2.doc

The latest 'release' can be explored at http://toontalk.github.io/ToonTalk/index.html. There are known problems with FireFox and Internet Explorer. We recommend you use Chrome until they are resolved.

The slides for a talk about this can be found at: http://toontalk.github.io/ToonTalk/talks/Intro/index.html?reset=1

A collection of ideas and plans are described in this Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s4QsdUahAZoLCXgHPtAv99D12jrrMFDrGDCK0rjfcdQ/
